Dell Optiplex 7010,"Dell Service Tag (they put this on all of their computers): C4HBX12. BIOS says ""Manufacture Date = 08/05/2014"" and ""Ownership Date = 09/05/2014"". The heatsink, fans, and vents are pretty clear for dust. Function keys during boot: F2 to enter the BIOS. F12 for boot options. F1, F3-F11 do nothing. BIOS version: A29 (this is the latest version. I checked on their website) Processor: Intel Core i5-3470 CPU @ 3.20GHz 3.20 GHz RAM: 12 GB. 4 DDR3 1600MHz slots with 2 sticks of 2 GB and 2 sticks of 4 GB. Maximum memory capacity: 16 GB Hard drive: 1 slot total, Western Digital Raptor, Recertified, 150 GB capacity, SATA. Hard drive caddy is there/included. OS: Windows 10 Pro, 64-bit/x64. The drive has been wiped clean and a fresh copy of the OS has been installed. It's a local account and I didn't set a password. You don't even have to click, 'Sign in'. Short version of what either has issues or I couldn't test: PS/2 ports - They need the devices already plugged in when you start the computer. Untested: DisplayPort, Serial port, Line-out, Line-in, expansion slots. Needs drivers: 'PCI Serial Port' and 'PCI Simple Communications Controller'. DVD+/-RW optical drive - Tested with playing a DVD on it and it works. I don't have the capability (and possibly the knowledge) to successfully burn a DVD or CD. 4 front USB ports (2 USB 2.0, 2 USB 3.0) - confirmed to work 1 front Microphone port - confirmed to work 1 front Headphone port - confirmed to work 1 PS/2 mouse port - confirmed to work. I found that it only works if you start the computer with the already mouse plugged in. 1 PS/2 keyboard port - confirmed to work. I found that it only works if you start the computer with the already keyboard plugged in. 1 Ethernet/RJ-45 port - confirmed to work 6 rear USB ports (4 USB 2.0, 2 USB 3.0) - confirmed to work (in a general sense. I haven't tested speeds) 2 Displayport ports - I don't have the means to test these 1 Serial port - I don't have the means to test this 1 VGA port - confirmed to work 1 Line-out/rear headphone port - I don't have the ability to test line-out, but testing headphones worked. 1 Line-in/rear Microphone port - I don't have the ability to test line-in, but testing a microphone worked. Wi-fi - it does not have wi-fi Bluetooth - it does not have bluetooth Speaker(s) - confirmed to work Built-in microphone - it does not have a built-in microphone. Device Manager shows there are two items with the yellow triangle symbol with the exclamation point inside.

Dell Optiplex 7010,"Dell Service Tag (they put this on all of their computers): C4HBX12. BIOS says ""Manufacture Date = 08/05/2014"" and ""Ownership Date = 09/05/2014"". The heatsink, fans, and vents are pretty clear for dust. Function keys during boot: F2 to enter the BIOS. F12 for boot options. F1, F3-F11 do nothing. BIOS version: A29 (this is the latest version.

GeForce 1060 6GB Gaming PC,"Selling an old gaming PC. It's roughly 8 years old and still runs strong without complaining. Never overclocked or used for Crypto.

I was shocked. Some of these places are charging the price of a whole new laptop to fix your old one. Most LCD replacement screens run $50-100 on ebay.

MSI GF63 Gaming Laptop,"This is the gf63, specifically the 2023 model with an rtx 4050 (laptop gpu) and an a i7 processor chip. I added 16 gb of ram so it now has 32gb of ddr4. Very clean case, one to two minor scuff marks. I’ve ran countless games on this thing over the last year or so and it has been beyond reliable. I play heavy pc vr titles and many demanding triple a games and have yet to experience any lag or buffer.

IBM Clicky model M Keyboard priced at,"Have available 1 IBM clicky buckling spring model M Keyboard as follows: model M with separate numeric keypad dated 1989. First come first serve. No holds Working with no issues when I stopped using this and has been retested when this was was posted. No damage. All key caps present. Never any spills, from non smoking, pet free home. This will come with a rare long cable that is PS2 type (smaller round style, NOT the older 5 pin DIN). If your system does not have any PS2 connectors you will need an adapter, I have no adapters. This style keyboard has made a resurgence and is rather popular is certain applications, can be used for general purposes. This type of positive feedback that this key design provides reminds me of the feel of the IBM Selectric interchangeable ball style fonts typewriters of the early 80's and perhaps is what IBM designers were trying to emulate in how these clicky buckling spring keys were made. I have 1 longer length cable that is included with the keyboard. Cables: IBM used a less common connector on the keyboard end to be able to supply different cables based on length, connector at computer end, color, etc. Longer length cable has approx 6 and a half foot long straight section, a coiled section that at rest is also approx 2 foot long that will stretch to 3-4 feet depending on force, and another straight section that connects to the keyboard itself about 6 inches long. (For reference, no Shorter length available but here is a description so you can see understand the difference, Shorter length cable has approx 2 foot long straight section, and a coiled section that at rest is also approx 2 foot long that will stretch to 3-4 feet depending on force, and another straight section that connects to the keyboard itself about 6 inches long.) This post will be kept up to date and removed promptly when appropriate, it is available if you can see this. If you are thinking about this - suggest you do not sit on your hands - only one I have. I have no spare cables or spare keyboards or spare parts available. Cash only. Meet during daylight hours. Shipping possible, these are the terms: No electronic payments, no checks, no money orders, no IOU's, no ACH, no trades. Cash only!! The kind that comes out of an ATM.

9306-24i SAS SATA Broadcom LSI AVAGO 12gbps 12gb/s PCIe Adapter card,"No texts, use email relay. Price above is per card. Two cards available right now. Will sell separately or together. If you get both cards at same time, will discount a total of $20. What flavor of IT mode (jbod) are you into? ZFS, FreeNAS, unRAID, something else? This card connects to a lot of drives, actually 24! If you have a bunch of 22TB drives (bigger drives are available) you can approach 0.5 Petabyte of storage (500 TB). This card of course handles sata and sas drives, and can mix. If you are not familiar with IT mode, this card uses a PCIe slot on your mainboard and will pass through drives connected to it to your OS for use as you choose. Any sata or sas drive will work can be different sizes depending on your need / use. Great way to add more drives / space to a system. This card is has 3 connectors, each attaches to 8 drives, total 24 drives. All 3 connectors are internal and use SFF-8654 type connector (see photos of cable), cables are readily available with a variety of connectors at the other end to suit your preference. Has large heatsink, and likely designed for high air flow server case. To be safe install only with a fan blowing on this heatsink to keep it cool unless in high air flow case. Comes with low profile bracket with ventilation holes, bracket can be changed with a screwdriver. With 24 drives attached to this card plus what your motherboard has for sata connections to add to that you could have a pretty amazing amount of storage at you fingertips. What to do with it? Up to you. With 24 drives available you can hit some rather amazing transfer rates for spinning magnetic drive at a mere fraction of the cost of solid state. 0.5 Petabyte (that's 500 terabytes) of storage that is solid state - well can't bring myself to imagine the cost factors to get that! On most motherboards you run out of PCIe slots at some point and you need a bigger card. Space is the final frontier. Can usually meet same day. Daylight hours only please. Cash only!!

IBM Clicky model M Keyboard priced at,"Have available 1 IBM clicky buckling spring model M Keyboard as follows: model M with separate numeric keypad dated 1989. First come first serve. No holds Working with no issues when I stopped using this and has been retested when this was was posted. No damage. All key caps present. Never any spills, from non smoking, pet free home. This will come with a rare long cable that is PS2 type (smaller round style, NOT the older 5 pin DIN). If your system does not have any PS2 connectors you will need an adapter, I have no adapters. This style keyboard has made a resurgence and is rather popular is certain applications, can be used for general purposes. This type of positive feedback that this key design provides reminds me of the feel of the IBM Selectric interchangeable ball style fonts typewriters of the early 80's and perhaps is what IBM designers were trying to emulate in how these clicky buckling spring keys were made. I have 1 longer length cable that is included with the keyboard. Cables: IBM used a less common connector on the keyboard end to be able to supply different cables based on length, connector at computer end, color, etc. Longer length cable has approx 6 and a half foot long straight section, a coiled section that at rest is also approx 2 foot long that will stretch to 3-4 feet depending on force, and another straight section that connects to the keyboard itself about 6 inches long. (For reference, no Shorter length available but here is a description so you can see understand the difference, Shorter length cable has approx 2 foot long straight section, and a coiled section that at rest is also approx 2 foot long that will stretch to 3-4 feet depending on force, and another straight section that connects to the keyboard itself about 6 inches long.) This post will be kept up to date and removed promptly when appropriate, it is available if you can see this. If you are thinking about this - suggest you do not sit on your hands - only one I have. I have no spare cables or spare keyboards or spare parts available. Cash only. Meet during daylight hours. Shipping possible, these are the terms: No electronic payments, no checks, no money orders, no IOU's, no ACH, no trades. Cash only!! The kind that comes out of an ATM.

9306-24i SAS SATA Broadcom LSI AVAGO 12gbps 12gb/s PCIe Adapter card,"No texts, use email relay. Price above is per card. Two cards available right now. Will sell separately or together. If you get both cards at same time, will discount a total of $20. What flavor of IT mode (jbod) are you into? ZFS, FreeNAS, unRAID, something else? This card connects to a lot of drives, actually 24! If you have a bunch of 22TB drives (bigger drives are available) you can approach 0.5 Petabyte of storage (500 TB). This card of course handles sata and sas drives, and can mix. If you are not familiar with IT mode, this card uses a PCIe slot on your mainboard and will pass through drives connected to it to your OS for use as you choose. Any sata or sas drive will work can be different sizes depending on your need / use. Great way to add more drives / space to a system. This card is has 3 connectors, each attaches to 8 drives, total 24 drives. All 3 connectors are internal and use SFF-8654 type connector (see photos of cable), cables are readily available with a variety of connectors at the other end to suit your preference. Has large heatsink, and likely designed for high air flow server case. To be safe install only with a fan blowing on this heatsink to keep it cool unless in high air flow case. Comes with low profile bracket with ventilation holes, bracket can be changed with a screwdriver. With 24 drives attached to this card plus what your motherboard has for sata connections to add to that you could have a pretty amazing amount of storage at you fingertips. What to do with it? Up to you. With 24 drives available you can hit some rather amazing transfer rates for spinning magnetic drive at a mere fraction of the cost of solid state. 0.5 Petabyte (that's 500 terabytes) of storage that is solid state - well can't bring myself to imagine the cost factors to get that! On most motherboards you run out of PCIe slots at some point and you need a bigger card. Space is the final frontier. Can usually meet same day. Daylight hours only please. Cash only!!

IBM Clicky model M Keyboard priced at,"Have available 1 IBM clicky buckling spring model M Keyboard as follows: model M with separate numeric keypad dated 1989. First come first serve. No holds Working with no issues when I stopped using this and has been retested when this was was posted. No damage. All key caps present. Never any spills, from non smoking, pet free home. This will come with a rare long cable that is PS2 type (smaller round style, NOT the older 5 pin DIN). If your system does not have any PS2 connectors you will need an adapter, I have no adapters. This style keyboard has made a resurgence and is rather popular is certain applications, can be used for general purposes. This type of positive feedback that this key design provides reminds me of the feel of the IBM Selectric interchangeable ball style fonts typewriters of the early 80's and perhaps is what IBM designers were trying to emulate in how these clicky buckling spring keys were made. I have 1 longer length cable that is included with the keyboard. Cables: IBM used a less common connector on the keyboard end to be able to supply different cables based on length, connector at computer end, color, etc. Longer length cable has approx 6 and a half foot long straight section, a coiled section that at rest is also approx 2 foot long that will stretch to 3-4 feet depending on force, and another straight section that connects to the keyboard itself about 6 inches long. (For reference, no Shorter length available but here is a description so you can see understand the difference, Shorter length cable has approx 2 foot long straight section, and a coiled section that at rest is also approx 2 foot long that will stretch to 3-4 feet depending on force, and another straight section that connects to the keyboard itself about 6 inches long.) This post will be kept up to date and removed promptly when appropriate, it is available if you can see this. If you are thinking about this - suggest you do not sit on your hands - only one I have. I have no spare cables or spare keyboards or spare parts available. Cash only. Meet during daylight hours. Shipping possible, these are the terms: No electronic payments, no checks, no money orders, no IOU's, no ACH, no trades. Cash only!! The kind that comes out of an ATM.

9306-24i SAS SATA Broadcom LSI AVAGO 12gbps 12gb/s PCIe Adapter card,"No texts, use email relay. Price above is per card. Two cards available right now. Will sell separately or together. If you get both cards at same time, will discount a total of $20. What flavor of IT mode (jbod) are you into? ZFS, FreeNAS, unRAID, something else? This card connects to a lot of drives, actually 24! If you have a bunch of 22TB drives (bigger drives are available) you can approach 0.5 Petabyte of storage (500 TB). This card of course handles sata and sas drives, and can mix. If you are not familiar with IT mode, this card uses a PCIe slot on your mainboard and will pass through drives connected to it to your OS for use as you choose. Any sata or sas drive will work can be different sizes depending on your need / use. Great way to add more drives / space to a system. This card is has 3 connectors, each attaches to 8 drives, total 24 drives. All 3 connectors are internal and use SFF-8654 type connector (see photos of cable), cables are readily available with a variety of connectors at the other end to suit your preference. Has large heatsink, and likely designed for high air flow server case. To be safe install only with a fan blowing on this heatsink to keep it cool unless in high air flow case. Comes with low profile bracket with ventilation holes, bracket can be changed with a screwdriver. With 24 drives attached to this card plus what your motherboard has for sata connections to add to that you could have a pretty amazing amount of storage at you fingertips. What to do with it? Up to you. With 24 drives available you can hit some rather amazing transfer rates for spinning magnetic drive at a mere fraction of the cost of solid state. 0.5 Petabyte (that's 500 terabytes) of storage that is solid state - well can't bring myself to imagine the cost factors to get that! On most motherboards you run out of PCIe slots at some point and you need a bigger card. Space is the final frontier. Can usually meet same day. Daylight hours only please. Cash only!!

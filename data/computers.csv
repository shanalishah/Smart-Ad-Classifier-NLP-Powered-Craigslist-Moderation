Dell Optiplex 7010,"Dell Service Tag (they put this on all of their computers): C4HBX12. BIOS says ""Manufacture Date = 08/05/2014"" and ""Ownership Date = 09/05/2014"". The heatsink, fans, and vents are pretty clear for dust. Function keys during boot: F2 to enter the BIOS. F12 for boot options. F1, F3-F11 do nothing. BIOS version: A29 (this is the latest version. I checked on their website) Processor: Intel Core i5-3470 CPU @ 3.20GHz 3.20 GHz RAM: 12 GB. 4 DDR3 1600MHz slots with 2 sticks of 2 GB and 2 sticks of 4 GB. Maximum memory capacity: 16 GB Hard drive: 1 slot total, Western Digital Raptor, Recertified, 150 GB capacity, SATA. Hard drive caddy is there/included. OS: Windows 10 Pro, 64-bit/x64. The drive has been wiped clean and a fresh copy of the OS has been installed. It's a local account and I didn't set a password. You don't even have to click, 'Sign in'. Short version of what either has issues or I couldn't test: PS/2 ports - They need the devices already plugged in when you start the computer. Untested: DisplayPort, Serial port, Line-out, Line-in, expansion slots. Needs drivers: 'PCI Serial Port' and 'PCI Simple Communications Controller'. DVD+/-RW optical drive - Tested with playing a DVD on it and it works. I don't have the capability (and possibly the knowledge) to successfully burn a DVD or CD. 4 front USB ports (2 USB 2.0, 2 USB 3.0) - confirmed to work 1 front Microphone port - confirmed to work 1 front Headphone port - confirmed to work 1 PS/2 mouse port - confirmed to work. I found that it only works if you start the computer with the already mouse plugged in. 1 PS/2 keyboard port - confirmed to work. I found that it only works if you start the computer with the already keyboard plugged in. 1 Ethernet/RJ-45 port - confirmed to work 6 rear USB ports (4 USB 2.0, 2 USB 3.0) - confirmed to work (in a general sense. I haven't tested speeds) 2 Displayport ports - I don't have the means to test these 1 Serial port - I don't have the means to test this 1 VGA port - confirmed to work 1 Line-out/rear headphone port - I don't have the ability to test line-out, but testing headphones worked. 1 Line-in/rear Microphone port - I don't have the ability to test line-in, but testing a microphone worked. Wi-fi - it does not have wi-fi Bluetooth - it does not have bluetooth Speaker(s) - confirmed to work Built-in microphone - it does not have a built-in microphone. Device Manager shows there are two items with the yellow triangle symbol with the exclamation point inside. They also have a question mark and are under ""Other devices"", which also has a question mark. It's 'PCI Serial Port' and 'PCI Simple Communications Controller'. When right-clicking and going to Properties, they say, ""The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28) There are no compatible drivers for this device.

It does not really affect the use of the monitor, and wasn‚Äôt very noticeable to me. I used it for 3 years this way. You can purchase replacement glass for these and swap it easily, but it never bothered me enough to do it. (The glass is held on only with magnets!) - The Magsafe1 plug does not power the laptop it seems (tested 4/15). Since this was the secondary monitor and the newer laptops use USB-C, I never used this for power. The price was reduced to account for these 2 issues."

Laptop Repairs - Screen replacements,"Laptop Repairs - Screen replacements Email me with the issue your having and I will provide an estimate. I do any repairs, but focusing on screen replacements because places are overcharging far to much for that service. I overheard someone the other day talking about their $1800 laptop that they cracked the screen on and the local computer place they called quoted them over a grand to replace the screen. I was shocked. Some of these places are charging the price of a whole new laptop to fix your old one. Most LCD replacement screens run $50-100 on ebay. I would research the part you need and send you a link so you can purchase the part yourself (no markups on parts) Then when you are available to meet, bring the part and I can do the install. I'd charge $80 for labor on an LCD replacement. Affordable rates and honest work I could meet you at a coffee place and do the replacement part or repair while you have a coffee. You can also drop off at house and pick up when ready if prefered"

Dell Optiplex 7010,"Dell Service Tag (they put this on all of their computers): C4HBX12. BIOS says ""Manufacture Date = 08/05/2014"" and ""Ownership Date = 09/05/2014"". The heatsink, fans, and vents are pretty clear for dust. Function keys during boot: F2 to enter the BIOS. F12 for boot options. F1, F3-F11 do nothing. BIOS version: A29 (this is the latest version. I checked on their website) Processor: Intel Core i5-3470 CPU @ 3.20GHz 3.20 GHz RAM: 12 GB. 4 DDR3 1600MHz slots with 2 sticks of 2 GB and 2 sticks of 4 GB. Maximum memory capacity: 16 GB Hard drive: 1 slot total, Western Digital Raptor, Recertified, 150 GB capacity, SATA. Hard drive caddy is there/included. OS: Windows 10 Pro, 64-bit/x64. The drive has been wiped clean and a fresh copy of the OS has been installed. It's a local account and I didn't set a password. You don't even have to click, 'Sign in'. Short version of what either has issues or I couldn't test: PS/2 ports - They need the devices already plugged in when you start the computer. Untested: DisplayPort, Serial port, Line-out, Line-in, expansion slots. Needs drivers: 'PCI Serial Port' and 'PCI Simple Communications Controller'. DVD+/-RW optical drive - Tested with playing a DVD on it and it works. I don't have the capability (and possibly the knowledge) to successfully burn a DVD or CD. 4 front USB ports (2 USB 2.0, 2 USB 3.0) - confirmed to work 1 front Microphone port - confirmed to work 1 front Headphone port - confirmed to work 1 PS/2 mouse port - confirmed to work. I found that it only works if you start the computer with the already mouse plugged in. 1 PS/2 keyboard port - confirmed to work. I found that it only works if you start the computer with the already keyboard plugged in. 1 Ethernet/RJ-45 port - confirmed to work 6 rear USB ports (4 USB 2.0, 2 USB 3.0) - confirmed to work (in a general sense. I haven't tested speeds) 2 Displayport ports - I don't have the means to test these 1 Serial port - I don't have the means to test this 1 VGA port - confirmed to work 1 Line-out/rear headphone port - I don't have the ability to test line-out, but testing headphones worked. 1 Line-in/rear Microphone port - I don't have the ability to test line-in, but testing a microphone worked. Wi-fi - it does not have wi-fi Bluetooth - it does not have bluetooth Speaker(s) - confirmed to work Built-in microphone - it does not have a built-in microphone. Device Manager shows there are two items with the yellow triangle symbol with the exclamation point inside. They also have a question mark and are under ""Other devices"", which also has a question mark. It's 'PCI Serial Port' and 'PCI Simple Communications Controller'. When right-clicking and going to Properties, they say, ""The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28) There are no compatible drivers for this device. To find a driver for this device, click Update Driver."". I searched for the updates using that and also by going to the Dell website and I couldn't find them. I already checked the BIOS to see if the PCI slot was disabled, it is not.

To make things easier for you and ready to use, I've gone through the settings and installed some programs/apps and browser extensions/add-ons. I aimed for a little more privacy and to make things less annoying for the user, while trying to make software better in the future (like providing diagnostic data so they can improve their software). I also tried to pick the best settings for most users and also leave some things be for you to set up or change to your personal preferences.

Apple 27‚Äù Thunderbolt Display A1407 - Couple issues: Read Description,"Apple 27‚Äù Thunderbolt Display A1407 - Crack in glass, Magsafe plug has no power 2560x1440 3x USB ports 1x FireWire 1x Thunderbolt 2 1x Gigabit Ethernet NOTE: Magsafe1 to Magsafe2 adapter not included This is a fantastic monitor and works extremely well. I was using a pair of these with MBP 15, 19, and 2024 using the TB3 to TB2 Apple Adapters. For the listed price I will include the Apple TB3 to TB2 adapter for newer Macs ($40 value). This is in good overall shape with no functional issues. The Thunderbolt 2/Laptop power cable was replaced. The original wall power cable was missing, but another standard power cable is included and functions perfectly. The Bad: - The glass on the front has a crack in the upper left side. It does not really affect the use of the monitor, and wasn‚Äôt very noticeable to me. I used it for 3 years this way. You can purchase replacement glass for these and swap it easily, but it never bothered me enough to do it. (The glass is held on only with magnets!) - The Magsafe1 plug does not power the laptop it seems (tested 4/15). Since this was the secondary monitor and the newer laptops use USB-C, I never used this for power. The price was reduced to account for these 2 issues."

Laptop Repairs - Screen replacements,"Laptop Repairs - Screen replacements Email me with the issue your having and I will provide an estimate. I do any repairs, but focusing on screen replacements because places are overcharging far to much for that service. I overheard someone the other day talking about their $1800 laptop that they cracked the screen on and the local computer place they called quoted them over a grand to replace the screen. I was shocked. Some of these places are charging the price of a whole new laptop to fix your old one. Most LCD replacement screens run $50-100 on ebay. I would research the part you need and send you a link so you can purchase the part yourself (no markups on parts) Then when you are available to meet, bring the part and I can do the install. I'd charge $80 for labor on an LCD replacement. Affordable rates and honest work I could meet you at a coffee place and do the replacement part or repair while you have a coffee. You can also drop off at house and pick up when ready if prefered"

IBM Clicky model M Keyboard priced at,"Have available 1 IBM clicky buckling spring model M Keyboard as follows: model M with separate numeric keypad dated 1989. First come first serve. No holds Working with no issues when I stopped using this and has been retested when this was was posted. No damage. All key caps present. Never any spills, from non smoking, pet free home. This will come with a rare long cable that is PS2 type (smaller round style, NOT the older 5 pin DIN). If your system does not have any PS2 connectors you will need an adapter, I have no adapters. This style keyboard has made a resurgence and is rather popular is certain applications, can be used for general purposes. This type of positive feedback that this key design provides reminds me of the feel of the IBM Selectric interchangeable ball style fonts typewriters of the early 80's and perhaps is what IBM designers were trying to emulate in how these clicky buckling spring keys were made. I have 1 longer length cable that is included with the keyboard. Cables: IBM used a less common connector on the keyboard end to be able to supply different cables based on length, connector at computer end, color, etc. Longer length cable has approx 6 and a half foot long straight section, a coiled section that at rest is also approx 2 foot long that will stretch to 3-4 feet depending on force, and another straight section that connects to the keyboard itself about 6 inches long. (For reference, no Shorter length available but here is a description so you can see understand the difference, Shorter length cable has approx 2 foot long straight section, and a coiled section that at rest is also approx 2 foot long that will stretch to 3-4 feet depending on force, and another straight section that connects to the keyboard itself about 6 inches long.) This post will be kept up to date and removed promptly when appropriate, it is available if you can see this. If you are thinking about this - suggest you do not sit on your hands - only one I have. I have no spare cables or spare keyboards or spare parts available. Cash only. Meet during daylight hours. Shipping possible, these are the terms: No electronic payments, no checks, no money orders, no IOU's, no ACH, no trades. Cash only!! The kind that comes out of an ATM. Keep payment type accepted in mind if you ask me to ship, you cover shipping costs. Shipping is easier for me if you provide a prepaid shipping label.

9306-24i SAS SATA Broadcom LSI AVAGO 12gbps 12gb/s PCIe Adapter card,"No texts, use email relay. Price above is per card. Two cards available right now. Will sell separately or together. If you get both cards at same time, will discount a total of $20. What flavor of IT mode (jbod) are you into? ZFS, FreeNAS, unRAID, something else? This card connects to a lot of drives, actually 24! If you have a bunch of 22TB drives (bigger drives are available) you can approach 0.5 Petabyte of storage (500 TB). This card of course handles sata and sas drives, and can mix. If you are not familiar with IT mode, this card uses a PCIe slot on your mainboard and will pass through drives connected to it to your OS for use as you choose. Any sata or sas drive will work can be different sizes depending on your need / use. Great way to add more drives / space to a system. This card is has 3 connectors, each attaches to 8 drives, total 24 drives. All 3 connectors are internal and use SFF-8654 type connector (see photos of cable), cables are readily available with a variety of connectors at the other end to suit your preference. Has large heatsink, and likely designed for high air flow server case. To be safe install only with a fan blowing on this heatsink to keep it cool unless in high air flow case. Comes with low profile bracket with ventilation holes, bracket can be changed with a screwdriver. With 24 drives attached to this card plus what your motherboard has for sata connections to add to that you could have a pretty amazing amount of storage at you fingertips. What to do with it? Up to you. With 24 drives available you can hit some rather amazing transfer rates for spinning magnetic drive at a mere fraction of the cost of solid state. 0.5 Petabyte (that's 500 terabytes) of storage that is solid state - well can't bring myself to imagine the cost factors to get that! On most motherboards you run out of PCIe slots at some point and you need a bigger card. Space is the final frontier. Can usually meet same day. Daylight hours only please. Cash only!! The kind that comes out of an ATM. No electronic payments, no trades, no checks, no ACH, no money orders, no IOU's. Keep payment type accepted in mind if you ask me to ship, you cover shipping costs, USPS preferred, then Fed-Ex or UPS. You supply a prepaid shipping label preferred."

Linksys Mesh Router,"Here are two Linksys Velop Mesh Routers for sale. One gets hooked up to your ISP and the other connects to the first by blutooth. There is an ethernet port under the mesh one. You would need to download the app to set this up and maintain it. I intended this as an extender system to use with my main Linksys router, but it wouldn't play nice. I should have ditched the main one and gone with these. I just got an Eero router with my new Frontier setup, so I don't need these. You get the two routers, the plugs and ethernet cables."
IBM Clicky model M Keyboard priced at,"Have available 1 IBM clicky buckling spring model M Keyboard as follows: model M with separate numeric keypad dated 1989. First come first serve. No holds Working with no issues when I stopped using this and has been retested when this was was posted. No damage. All key caps present. Never any spills, from non smoking, pet free home. This will come with a rare long cable that is PS2 type (smaller round style, NOT the older 5 pin DIN). If your system does not have any PS2 connectors you will need an adapter, I have no adapters. This style keyboard has made a resurgence and is rather popular is certain applications, can be used for general purposes. This type of positive feedback that this key design provides reminds me of the feel of the IBM Selectric interchangeable ball style fonts typewriters of the early 80's and perhaps is what IBM designers were trying to emulate in how these clicky buckling spring keys were made. I have 1 longer length cable that is included with the keyboard. Cables: IBM used a less common connector on the keyboard end to be able to supply different cables based on length, connector at computer end, color, etc. Longer length cable has approx 6 and a half foot long straight section, a coiled section that at rest is also approx 2 foot long that will stretch to 3-4 feet depending on force, and another straight section that connects to the keyboard itself about 6 inches long. (For reference, no Shorter length available but here is a description so you can see understand the difference, Shorter length cable has approx 2 foot long straight section, and a coiled section that at rest is also approx 2 foot long that will stretch to 3-4 feet depending on force, and another straight section that connects to the keyboard itself about 6 inches long.) This post will be kept up to date and removed promptly when appropriate, it is available if you can see this. If you are thinking about this - suggest you do not sit on your hands - only one I have. I have no spare cables or spare keyboards or spare parts available. Cash only. Meet during daylight hours. Shipping possible, these are the terms: No electronic payments, no checks, no money orders, no IOU's, no ACH, no trades. Cash only!! The kind that comes out of an ATM. Keep payment type accepted in mind if you ask me to ship, you cover shipping costs. Shipping is easier for me if you provide a prepaid shipping label. USPS is closest, but UPS, or FedEx can be done."

9306-24i SAS SATA Broadcom LSI AVAGO 12gbps 12gb/s PCIe Adapter card,"No texts, use email relay. Price above is per card. Two cards available right now. Will sell separately or together. If you get both cards at same time, will discount a total of $20. What flavor of IT mode (jbod) are you into? ZFS, FreeNAS, unRAID, something else? This card connects to a lot of drives, actually 24! If you have a bunch of 22TB drives (bigger drives are available) you can approach 0.5 Petabyte of storage (500 TB). This card of course handles sata and sas drives, and can mix. If you are not familiar with IT mode, this card uses a PCIe slot on your mainboard and will pass through drives connected to it to your OS for use as you choose. Any sata or sas drive will work can be different sizes depending on your need / use. Great way to add more drives / space to a system. This card is has 3 connectors, each attaches to 8 drives, total 24 drives. All 3 connectors are internal and use SFF-8654 type connector (see photos of cable), cables are readily available with a variety of connectors at the other end to suit your preference. Has large heatsink, and likely designed for high air flow server case. To be safe install only with a fan blowing on this heatsink to keep it cool unless in high air flow case. Comes with low profile bracket with ventilation holes, bracket can be changed with a screwdriver. With 24 drives attached to this card plus what your motherboard has for sata connections to add to that you could have a pretty amazing amount of storage at you fingertips. What to do with it? Up to you. With 24 drives available you can hit some rather amazing transfer rates for spinning magnetic drive at a mere fraction of the cost of solid state. 0.5 Petabyte (that's 500 terabytes) of storage that is solid state - well can't bring myself to imagine the cost factors to get that! On most motherboards you run out of PCIe slots at some point and you need a bigger card. Space is the final frontier. Can usually meet same day. Daylight hours only please. Cash only!! The kind that comes out of an ATM. No electronic payments, no trades, no checks, no ACH, no money orders, no IOU's. Keep payment type accepted in mind if you ask me to ship, you cover shipping costs, USPS preferred, then Fed-Ex or UPS. You supply a prepaid shipping label preferred."

IBM Clicky model M Keyboard priced at,"Have available 1 IBM clicky buckling spring model M Keyboard as follows: model M with separate numeric keypad dated 1989. First come first serve. No holds Working with no issues when I stopped using this and has been retested when this was was posted. No damage. All key caps present. Never any spills, from non smoking, pet free home. This will come with a rare long cable that is PS2 type (smaller round style, NOT the older 5 pin DIN). If your system does not have any PS2 connectors you will need an adapter, I have no adapters. This style keyboard has made a resurgence and is rather popular is certain applications, can be used for general purposes. This type of positive feedback that this key design provides reminds me of the feel of the IBM Selectric interchangeable ball style fonts typewriters of the early 80's and perhaps is what IBM designers were trying to emulate in how these clicky buckling spring keys were made. I have 1 longer length cable that is included with the keyboard. Cables: IBM used a less common connector on the keyboard end to be able to supply different cables based on length, connector at computer end, color, etc. Longer length cable has approx 6 and a half foot long straight section, a coiled section that at rest is also approx 2 foot long that will stretch to 3-4 feet depending on force, and another straight section that connects to the keyboard itself about 6 inches long. (For reference, no Shorter length available but here is a description so you can see understand the difference, Shorter length cable has approx 2 foot long straight section, and a coiled section that at rest is also approx 2 foot long that will stretch to 3-4 feet depending on force, and another straight section that connects to the keyboard itself about 6 inches long.) This post will be kept up to date and removed promptly when appropriate, it is available if you can see this. If you are thinking about this - suggest you do not sit on your hands - only one I have. I have no spare cables or spare keyboards or spare parts available. Cash only. Meet during daylight hours. Shipping possible, these are the terms: No electronic payments, no checks, no money orders, no IOU's, no ACH, no trades. Cash only!! The kind that comes out of an ATM. Keep payment type accepted in mind if you ask me to ship, you cover shipping costs. Shipping is easier for me if you provide a prepaid shipping label.

9306-24i SAS SATA Broadcom LSI AVAGO 12gbps 12gb/s PCIe Adapter card,"No texts, use email relay. Price above is per card. Two cards available right now. Will sell separately or together. If you get both cards at same time, will discount a total of $20. What flavor of IT mode (jbod) are you into? ZFS, FreeNAS, unRAID, something else? This card connects to a lot of drives, actually 24! If you have a bunch of 22TB drives (bigger drives are available) you can approach 0.5 Petabyte of storage (500 TB). This card of course handles sata and sas drives, and can mix. If you are not familiar with IT mode, this card uses a PCIe slot on your mainboard and will pass through drives connected to it to your OS for use as you choose. Any sata or sas drive will work can be different sizes depending on your need / use. Great way to add more drives / space to a system. This card is has 3 connectors, each attaches to 8 drives, total 24 drives. All 3 connectors are internal and use SFF-8654 type connector (see photos of cable), cables are readily available with a variety of connectors at the other end to suit your preference. Has large heatsink, and likely designed for high air flow server case. To be safe install only with a fan blowing on this heatsink to keep it cool unless in high air flow case. Comes with low profile bracket with ventilation holes, bracket can be changed with a screwdriver. With 24 drives attached to this card plus what your motherboard has for sata connections to add to that you could have a pretty amazing amount of storage at you fingertips. What to do with it? Up to you. With 24 drives available you can hit some rather amazing transfer rates for spinning magnetic drive at a mere fraction of the cost of solid state. 0.5 Petabyte (that's 500 terabytes) of storage that is solid state - well can't bring myself to imagine the cost factors to get that! On most motherboards you run out of PCIe slots at some point and you need a bigger card. Space is the final frontier. Can usually meet same day. Daylight hours only please. Cash only!!
